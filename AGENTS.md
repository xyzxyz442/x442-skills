# AGENTS.md

<!-- TODO: one-line description of this skills collection. -->

This repository is the **single source of truth** for AI assistants working in this project. Tool-specific overrides live in:

- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — Claude Code
- [ANTIGRAVITY.md](ANTIGRAVITY.md) — Antigravity
- [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md) — Gemini CLI (transitioning to Antigravity, see migration link in GEMINI.md)
- [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) — GitHub Copilot

Read this file first, then your tool-specific file for any overrides.

## Project overview

`x442-skills` is a collection of agent skills — reusable, model-agnostic capability packs written in markdown. Skills extend an AI assistant's behavior in a discoverable, on-demand way: the assistant reads a skill's frontmatter to decide _when_ to invoke it, then loads the body for the _how_.

The repo contains **no application code**. Everything ships as markdown plus the occasional supporting reference file.

```

## Skill authoring conventions

Every skill is a directory under `skills/` containing a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: x442-kebab-case-skill-name
description: One sentence that tells the assistant WHEN to use this skill. Be specific about triggers.
---

Skill body — instructions, examples, checklists, references.
```

Rules:

- **`name`**: lowercase kebab-case, **`x442-`-prefixed**, matching the directory name's
  unprefixed part (folder `initial-project` → `name: x442-initial-project`). The directory stays
  **unprefixed**; the prefix lives in the frontmatter so the installed slash-command is
  unambiguous across environments (a skill from this repo never collides with a same-named
  personal or built-in skill) and shows on every install path — `npx skills add` and the Claude
  plugin marketplace read the frontmatter `name`, while the dev-loop link scripts also prefix the
  symlink directory.
- **`description`**: the only thing the assistant sees at discovery time. Lead with trigger conditions ("Use when…"). Keep under ~200 chars.
- **Markdown-first**: most skills ship markdown only, with supporting samples/data under `references/`. Setup and automation skills _may_ ship executables (shell, Python) and config payloads — put runnable scripts under `scripts/` and bundled payloads (templates, config) under `assets/`. The no-destructive-shell-commands house rule still applies to every shipped file.
- **One skill, one purpose**: if a skill describes two unrelated workflows, split it.
- **Link, don't duplicate**: cross-reference other skills with relative links instead of copying their content.

## Skill Index

| Category      | Skill                   | Status         | Purpose                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `engineering` | `initial-project`       | `stable`       | Set up a project's AI-assistant config around a shared `AGENTS.md`, detecting and wiring each tool to it.                                 |
| `engineering` | `setup-project-tooling` | `experimental` | Detect the project profile and scaffold matching dev tooling (commitlint+husky, lint-staged, release-it). Chains after `initial-project`. |
| `engineering` | `setup-graph-hooks`     | `stable`       | Wire a self-updating code knowledge graph so agents query the graph instead of grepping. Chains after `initial-project`.                  |

Full per-skill detail (prerequisites, verification harness, status meanings) lives in the
[skills catalog](skills/README.md). Folders stay unprefixed; the `x442-` prefix lives in each
skill's frontmatter `name` (e.g. `initial-project/` → `name: x442-initial-project`).

## House rules

- **Formatting**: defer to [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) — UTF-8, LF, 2-space indent, final newline. Markdown files keep trailing whitespace (line-break semantics).
- **No emojis** in skill content unless a skill is explicitly about emoji usage.
- **No destructive shell commands** in examples. Use `trash` instead of `rm`; never demonstrate `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, or `git reset --hard` without an explicit safety rail.
- **Cite sources** when a skill encodes external API behavior or a vendor convention — link to the upstream doc so future-you can verify it still holds.
- **Voice**: imperative, second person ("Do X", "Avoid Y"). No marketing language.

## Coding guidelines

Follow the [Karpathy coding guidelines](skills/engineering/initial-project/references/karpathy-guidelines.md) for all work in this project.

## Commit conventions

Follow the [commit guidelines](skills/engineering/initial-project/references/commit-guidelines.md): Conventional Commits `type(scope): subject` (lowercase imperative subject, no trailing period). The enforced ruleset is [`commitlint.config.mjs`](commitlint.config.mjs) — the single source of truth; `setup-project-tooling` wires the husky `commit-msg` hook and CI that enforce it.

## Workflow

To add a new skill:

1. Create `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with the frontmatter shape above.
2. Write the body — start with _when to use_, then _how_, then _examples_.
3. <!-- TODO: lint/validation command once one exists. -->
4. Commit. One skill per commit keeps history reviewable.

To edit an existing skill: change `SKILL.md` in place; don't fork into a `v2/` directory.

## Knowledge Graph (code navigation)

This repo has a self-updating code knowledge graph. **Before** you grep, find, glob, or read
multiple source files to answer a code question, query the graph — it is far cheaper and more
precise. Reach for it when you:

- answer architecture, cross-module, or "how does X work" questions
- are about to grep / find / glob the codebase
- need to trace a call chain or get oriented in an unfamiliar module
- are about to refactor something with unclear blast radius

Routing (CRG first, graphify on miss, grep last):

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| where is X defined | `semantic_search_nodes_tool(query=X)` |
| who calls / imports X | `query_graph_tool(pattern=callers_of\|importers, target=X)` |
| pre-refactor blast radius | `get_impact_radius_tool(changed_files=[...])` |
| code review / PR impact | `get_review_context_tool(changed_files=[...])` |
| architecture overview | `list_communities_tool()` — never `get_architecture_overview_tool` |
| CRG miss / neighborhood explore | `graphify query '<term>' --graph graphify-out/graph.json` |
| shortest path A→B | `graphify path '<A>' '<B>' --graph graphify-out/graph.json` |
| string / config / log text | `grep` (append `--graph-tried` to bypass the graph gate) |

If no graph exists yet, ask to run: `code-review-graph build && code-review-graph embed`.
The graph refreshes automatically (the primary tool's end-of-turn hook + a git post-commit
refresh that runs regardless of tool); you do not need to rebuild it manually after edits.
